The basic configuration for the competitions requires a Windows computer to run SIGVerse as well as an Ubuntu computer to run ROS nodes created by the participants.   
These two computers should be connected to a switching hub.  

See https://github.com/SIGVerse/sigverse_unity_project/wiki for information about SIGVerse.
